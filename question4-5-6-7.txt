question 4:

    Give the name and length of the third largest gene in the genome.
    
    querry:

        SELECT gene_name, (seq_region_end-seq_region_start) AS length
        FROM gene
        ORDER BY length DESC
        LIMIT 2,1;
    
    Answer: 
        # gene_name, length
        PARP1, 2493039


question 5:

        Give the name of the gene with the most exons? Give the number of exons of this gene?

     querry:

        SELECT COUNT(g.gene_name), g.gene_name
        FROM gene g
        JOIN transcript t ON t.gene_id=g.gene_id
        JOIN exon_transcript et ON et.transcript_id=t.transcript_id
        JOIN exon e on e.exon_id=et.exon_id
        GROUP BY g.gene_name
        ORDER BY COUNT(g.gene_name) DESC
        LIMIT 1;
    
    Answer: 
        '# amount of exons, gene_name
        3598, COL11A2

question 6:

    Give the name of the chromosome with the most genes associated with breast cancer. 
    Give the number of transcripts of this chromosome? (2 queries)
    
    querry:

        SELECT count(*) as "amount of genes", chromosome
        FROM gene
        WHERE description REGEXP ('breast') AND description REGEXP ('cancer|carcinoma')
        GROUP BY chromosome
        ORDER BY count(*) DESC
        LIMIT 1;

        SELECT count(t.transcript_id) AS "amount of transcripts"
        FROM gene g
        JOIN transcript t ON t.gene_id=g.gene_id
        WHERE g.chromosome REGEXP('^1$');
        
    Answer: 

        # amount of genes, chromosome
        3, 1

        # amount of transcripts
        17641
        
question 7:

    Give the number of rows from the exon table and do the same for the exon_transcript table (2 queries). 
    Explain why there is a difference in number of rows.
    
    querry:

        SELECT count(exon_id) AS "amount of exons"
        FROM exon;

        SELECT count(exon_id) AS "count exons in transcript"
        FROM exon_transcript;

    Answer: 
       # amount of exons
        642590

        # count exons in transcript
        1178393

        Exon is the coding regon, transcript exon are the translations, there are more different transcripts because of atlernative splicing
